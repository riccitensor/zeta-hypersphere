# zeta-hypersphere

This project demonstrates how to map points from the Riemann zeta function to a 4D hypersphere and visualize them using a 3D projection. The project uses the `mpmath` library to compute the Riemann zeta function for complex numbers and the `matplotlib` library to create 3D plots.

## Installation

Before running the project, make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install mpmath
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
